        <h2>The Pilot Session</h2>
        <p class="flow-text">The Pilot Session is a single full day event we are running in order to kick off the Hack Lab. It will be an awesome day of building and meeting other like minded young people.</p>

        <h3>When is it?</h3>
        <p class="flow-text">We hope to be able to bring this pilot session to you sometime in early March or April. Once we have a date set we will be sure to push it out to all of our subscribers on <a class="deep-purple-text" href="#join-now">our mailing list</a>.</p>

        <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
