        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="flow-text">We at the Hack Lab are creating the community we wished we had when we were learning to code. Basically, we are bringing together a bunch of talented mentors, high schooler programmers (of all skill levels), and cool technology. It is our belief that a proper programming education should be available to everyone.</p>
