        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

        <p class="flow-text">At the Hack Lab we are building the community we wished had existed in Sydney while we were learning to code. We are bringing together young people from all across Sydney and providing them an environment to network, learn and show off with others interested in technology.</p>

        <h2>Club Meetings</h2>

        <p class="flow-text">Starting in early May we will start running our weekly club meetings. Each week, attendees will have the option of participating in a workshop ran by the staff of the Hack Lab, or work with their friends on whatever they want. Mentors will be walking around, helping solve problems and giving advice to both groups. We want to make this club as accessible as possible, it will be free and cater to all skill levels.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">More information coming soon. Sign up below to hear more when we are ready.</p>
