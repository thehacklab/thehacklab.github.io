        <h2>The Pilot Session</h2>
        <p class="flow-text">The Pilot Session is a single full day event we are running in order to kick off the Hack Lab. It will be an awesome day of building and meeting other like minded young people.</p>

        <h3>When is it?</h3>
        <p class="flow-text">We hope to be able to bring this pilot session to you sometime in early March or April. Once we have a date set we will be sure to push it out to all of our subscribers on <a class="deep-purple-text" href="#join-now">our mailing list</a>.</p>

        <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
        <p class="flow-text">This event is targeted at people who have not graduated High School. It is not just for beginners though, and will be catering for every skill level! If you are in University or beyond and would like to get involved <a class="deep-purple-text" href="mailto:harrison@thehacklab.xyz">email Harrison (harrison [at] thehacklab [dot] xyz)</a>.</p>

        <h3>What exactly is happening?</h3>
