        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p class="flow-text">At the Hack Lab we are creating the community we wished existed when we were learning to code. We are bringing together young people interested in technology from all across Sydney and providing an environment for them to learn in whatever way they wish. It is our belief that a proper programming education should be available to everyone.</p>

        <p class="flow-text">For each session we bring together a team of passionate mentors and an interesting host of new technologies for our members to mess around with.</p>
